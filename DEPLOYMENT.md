# RMEDUSC Voting App Deployment Guide

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one
2. Create a new repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/rmedusc-voting.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
3. Go to repository Settings > Pages
4. Select 'main' branch and save
5. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/rmedusc-voting`

## Option 2: Netlify (Free)
1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Drag and drop your entire folder to Netlify's upload area
4. Site will be live instantly with a random URL
5. Can set custom domain in settings

## Option 3: Local Network (College/University)
1. Find your computer's IP address:
   - Windows: Open CMD and type `ipconfig`
   - Mac/Linux: Open Terminal and type `ifconfig`
2. Install a simple HTTP server:
```bash
# Using Python (usually pre-installed on Mac/Linux)
python -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
3. Access website from other computers on same network:
   - `http://YOUR_IP:8080`

## Important Security Notes
1. Current version uses sessionStorage which is temporary
2. For real elections, implement:
   - User authentication
   - Server-side vote storage
   - Vote verification
   - SSL/HTTPS encryption

## Files to Deploy
Make sure to include all these files:
- index.html
- voting.html
- rme10.html
- thankyou.html
- votes.js
- clublogo.png (if used)

## Testing Before Deployment
1. Check all links work
2. Test voting flow
3. Verify vote counting
4. Test on different devices/browsers
5. Ensure all files are included

## Need More Security?
For a more secure voting system:
1. Set up a backend server (Node.js/Express)
2. Use a database (MongoDB/MySQL)
3. Add user authentication
4. Enable HTTPS
5. Implement vote verification
